In the Tutorial of OpenClassRoom, they propose to make our own Hangman game. I try to make it similar in the aspect but the coding is different.

Version :

17 June = Create the Game with Fenetre 

18 June = RulesPanel / AccueilPanel

20 June = Add GamePanels / ImageLabel / Word

21 June =  ScorePanel / Score

22 June = Add Serialisation of the score / English Language and option to switch dictionary and language / Correction of bug with the Ï and no name

23 June =  correction of bug with word-word in French Langage

30 June = add easy mode

TODO : add buyable bonus
