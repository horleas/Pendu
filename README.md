In the Tutorial of OpenClassRoom, they propose to make our own Hangingman game. I try to make it similar in the aspect but the coding is different.

Version :
17 June = Create the Game with Fenetre 
18 June = RulesPanel / AccueilPanel
20 June = Add GamePanels / ImageLabel / Word
21 June =  ScorePanel / Score
22 June = Add Serialisation of the score

next to do : Add English language
